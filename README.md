# Excel-ColumnResizer

This set of subroutines will resize a column to more closely match the appropriate width of the header cell, instead of basing the size off of the longest cell value in the column. This should prevent issues where the column's width becomes much longer than the screen can display without zooming out to an absurd degree.
